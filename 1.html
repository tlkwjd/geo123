<h2>Structural geology</h2>
    <p> Structural geology is the study of the three-dimensional distribution of rock units with respect to their deformational histories. The primary goal of structural geology is to use measurements of present-day rock geometries to uncover information about the history of deformation (strain) in the rocks, and ultimately, to understand the stress field that resulted in the observed strain and geometries. This understanding of the dynamics of the stress field can be linked to important events in the geologic past; a common goal is to understand the structural evolution of a particular area with respect to regionally widespread patterns of rock deformation (e.g., mountain building, rifting) due to plate tectonics. </p>  
 <a href="https://opentutorials.org/course/3084/18418" target="_blank" title="web study">Geology is an earth science</a> concerned with the solid Earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change over time. <p><br> Geology can also include the study of the solid features of any terrestrial planet or natural satellite such as Mars or the Moon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 70px;">Modern geology significantly overlaps all other earth sciences, including hydrology and the atmospheric sciences, and so is treated as one major aspect of integrated earth system science and planetary science.</p>
