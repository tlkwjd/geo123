<h2>Petrology</h2>
지질학은 자연의 비밀을 밝혀내기 위한 과학의 한 분과이다.<br>
Geology is a field of the science that <strong>uncovers the <u>secrets</u> of nature.</strong> 


    <a href="https://opentutorials.org/course/3084/18418" target="_blank" title="web study">Geology is an earth science</a> concerned with the solid Earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change over time. <p><br> Geology can also include the study of the solid features of any terrestrial planet or natural satellite such as Mars or the Moon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 70px;">Modern geology significantly overlaps all other earth sciences, including hydrology and the atmospheric sciences, and so is treated as one major aspect of integrated earth system science and planetary science.</p>
